        <h2>The Impact of Internet Technology</h2>

                <h3>Energy Consumption</h3>
                <br>
                <p>High energy use in data centers.</p>
                <p></p>
                <br>
                <p>Data centers, which store and process vast amounts of digital information, require significant energy for both operation and cooling. As internet usage grows, so does the demand for larger, more powerful servers, leading to greater energy consumption. It is estimated that data centers now consume about 1% of global electricity. Initiatives like optimizing cooling systems, adopting renewable energy sources, and improving server efficiency are being explored to reduce this energy footprint. However, without aggressive changes, the environmental impact of energy use in this sector will continue to rise.</p>

                <h3>E-Waste Generation</h3>
                <p>Increasing electronic waste.</p>
                <p>As technology evolves rapidly, consumers frequently upgrade devices, leading to a significant amount of discarded electronics. E-waste includes computers, phones, and other digital devices that are improperly disposed of. In 2023 alone, it is estimated that over 50 million metric tons of e-waste was generated worldwide. Many of these discarded electronics contain hazardous materials like mercury and lead, which can harm the environment if not properly recycled. Promoting sustainable manufacturing, repair, and recycling practices can help mitigate the impact of e-waste on the environment.</p>

                <h3>Carbon Footprint</h3>
                <p>Impact on climate change.</p>
                <p>The digital ecosystem significantly contributes to greenhouse gas emissions through the energy required to run infrastructure such as data centers, transmission networks, and end-user devices. While individual devices may not seem like major emitters, the global digital economy has a collective carbon footprint comparable to the aviation industry. Efforts to reduce this impact include investing in greener technologies and renewable energy sources, as well as optimizing the energy efficiency of network equipment. Nevertheless, the growing demand for digital services, including streaming and cloud computing, continues to drive up emissions.</p>

                <h3>Digital Divide</h3>
                <p>Disparities in internet access.</p>
                <p>Despite advancements in technology, millions of people worldwide still lack access to reliable internet. This "digital divide" disproportionately affects rural and underdeveloped areas, where internet infrastructure is either lacking or too expensive to install. Without internet access, people are excluded from economic opportunities, educational resources, and healthcare information. Bridging the gap requires not only investment in infrastructure but also affordable internet services, digital literacy programs, and policy interventions that prioritize connectivity for underserved populations. The goal is to ensure everyone benefits equally from the digital age.</p>
