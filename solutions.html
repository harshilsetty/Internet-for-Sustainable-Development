                <h3>Green Data Centers</h3>
                <p>With the rapid expansion of cloud services, data centers have become massive energy consumers. To combat this, many companies are adopting green data centers that rely on renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydropower. These centers are also optimized for energy efficiency through advanced cooling techniques and energy-saving technologies, reducing their overall environmental impact.</p>

                <h3>E-Waste Recycling</h3>
                <p>Electronic waste is a growing problem globally. Sustainable Net promotes responsible e-waste recycling programs that ensure old electronics are either reused, refurbished, or properly dismantled. Specialized facilities extract precious metals and safely dispose of hazardous materials. Public awareness campaigns also encourage consumers to recycle rather than discard their old devices.</p>

                <h3>Sustainable Web Design</h3>
                <p>Web design can significantly impact energy consumption. Sustainable Net advocates for eco-friendly web design practices such as optimizing images, reducing page load times, and limiting the use of large JavaScript files. By designing websites that consume fewer resources, businesses can reduce their carbon footprint and provide a faster, more efficient browsing experience.</p>

                <h3>Bridging the Digital Divide</h3>
                <p>Access to the internet is unevenly distributed, with rural and low-income communities often left behind. Sustainable Net supports initiatives that bridge the digital divide by offering affordable internet solutions, expanding infrastructure, and providing educational programs to underserved populations. Equal access to information is a key aspect of a sustainable digital future.</p>
